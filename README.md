### My [Pool](https://etc.yu-tam.contact).

* open-etc-pool-friends wallet ETC: 0xd92fa5a9732a0aec36dc8d5a6a1305dc2d3e09e6

### Features

### Email: office.poolnode@gmail.com

### [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeSEGwWB8LWtu7BM8OpH6yA).

### [hey come check out Discord with me](https://discord.gg/zdnuXm4uby).

**This pool is being further developed to provide an easy to use pool for Ethereum Classic miners. This software is functional however an optimised release of the pool is expected soon. Testing and bug submissions are welcome!**

* Support for HTTP and Stratum mining
* Detailed block stats with luck percentage and full reward
* Failover geth instances: geth high availability built in
* Separate stats for workers: can highlight timed-out workers so miners can perform maintenance of rigs
* JSON-API for stats
* New vue based UI
* Supports Ethereum Classic, Mordor, Ethereum, Ropsten, ubiq

### Building on Linux

Dependencies:

  * go >= 1.19
  * core-geth
  * redis-server >= 2.8.0
  * nodejs >= 4 LTS
  * nginx

### Install go lang

    $ sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
    $ sudo apt-get install golang
    
### Install npm
    sudo apt-get install npm

### Install redis-server

    $ sudo apt-get install redis-server

It is recommended to bind your DB address on 127.0.0.1 or on internal ip. Also, please set up the password for advanced security!!!

### Install nginx

    $ sudo apt-get install nginx

Search on Google for nginx-setting

### Install NODE

This will install the latest nodejs

    $ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_19.x | sudo -E bash -
    $ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
    
### Run core-geth   

**I highly recommend to use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.**
 1. First install:  sudo apt-get install build-essential
 2. install   sudo apt-get install make
 3. install   sudo apt-get install git
 4. install  [core-geth](https://github.com/etclabscore/core-geth/releases).

 
 Run console 
 
 New Wallet
 ```
 geth account new --datadir /home/pool/classic/.ethereum/
```
If you use Ubuntu, it is easier to control services by using serviced.

    $ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/geth.service
    
 Copy the following example

```

[Unit]
Description=geth
After=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/pool/core-geth/build/bin/geth --datadir /home/pool/classic/.ethereum/ --syncmode "snap" --http --http.api eth,net,web3,txpool,miner --miner.etherbase=0x95f296f317E8E3AFb3DEf009173E77cCe00B5aeC --mine --cache=8000 --maxpeers 100 --password="/home/pool/.pw" --allow-insecure-unlock --http.port "8545" --nat "any" --unlock 0x95f296f317E8E3AFb3DEf009173E77cCe00B5aeC --miner.extradata ys --classic --snapshot=false --port 30305

User=pool

Restart=always
RestartSec=3

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```
    
Then run core-geth by the following commands

    $ sudo systemctl enable geth
    $ sudo systemctl start geth

If you want to debug the node command

    $ sudo systemctl status geth
    
### Open Firewall

Firewall should be opened to operate this service. Whether Ubuntu firewall is basically opened or not, the firewall should be opened based on your situation.
You can open firewall by opening 80,443,8008,30305.


Clone & compile:
    
    git clone https://github.com/yuriy0803/open-etc-pool-friends.git
    cd open-etc-pool-friends
   
    go build


## Install Frontend

### Modify configuration file

    $ nano ~/open-etc-pool-friends/www/config/environment.js

Make some modifications in these settings.

    ApiUrl: '//your-pool-domain/',
    HttpHost: 'http://your-pool-domain',
    StratumHost: 'your-pool-domain',
    PoolFee: '1%',

The frontend is a single-page Ember.js application that polls the pool API to render miner stats.

### Running Pool

    ./open-etc-pool-friends api.json


### Building Frontend

Install nodejs. I suggest using LTS version >= 4.x from https://github.com/nodesource/distributions or from your Linux distribution or simply install nodejs on Ubuntu Xenial 16.04.

> NOTE: at this point keep your nodejs version <= 19.x.

The frontend is a single-page Ember.js application that polls the pool API to render miner stats.

    cd www

Change <code>ApiUrl: '//example.net/'</code> in <code>www/config/environment.js</code> to match your domain name. Also don't forget to adjust other options.

Install deps

    $ sudo npm install -g ember-cli@2.18
    $ sudo npm install -g bower
    $ sudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP ~/.npm
    $ sudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP ~/.config
    $ npm install
    $ bower install
    $ ember install ember-truth-helpers
    $ npm install jdenticon@2.1.0

Build.
     
     chmod 755 build.sh
    ./build.sh
    
    
### Run Pool api.json
It is required to run pool by serviced. If it is not, the terminal could be stopped, and pool doesn’t work.

    $ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/api.service

Copy the following example

```
[Unit]
Description=api
After=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/pool/open-etc-pool-friends /home/pool/api.json

User=pool

Restart=always
RestartSec=3

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Then run api by the following commands

    $ sudo systemctl enable api
    $ sudo systemctl start api

If you want to debug the node command

    $ sudo systemctl status api

As you can see above, the frontend of the pool homepage is created. Then, move to the directory, www, which services the file.

Set up nginx.

    $ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

Modify based on configuration file.

    # Default server configuration
    # nginx example

    upstream api {
        server 127.0.0.1:8080;
    }

    server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;
        root /var/www/etc2pool;

        # Add index.php to the list if you are using PHP
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name _;

        location / {
                # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }

        location /api {
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        }

    }

After setting nginx is completed, run the command below.

    $ sudo service nginx restart
    $ sudo journalctl -f     //status all 
    
    
#### Customization

You can customize the layout using built-in web server with live reload:

    ember server --port 8082 --environment development

**Don't use built-in web server in production**.

Check out <code>www/app/templates</code> directory and edit these templates
in order to customise the frontend.

### Configuration

Configuration is actually simple, just read it twice and think twice before changing defaults.

**Don't copy config directly from this manual. Use the example config from the package,
otherwise you will get errors on start because of JSON comments.**

```

If you are distributing your pool deployment to several servers or processes,
create several configs and disable unneeded modules on each server. (Advanced users)

I recommend this deployment strategy:

* Mining instance - 1x (it depends, you can run one node for EU, one for US, one for Asia)
* Unlocker and payouts instance - 1x each (strict!)
* API instance - 1x

### Notes

* Unlocking and payouts are sequential, 1st tx go, 2nd waiting for 1st to confirm and so on. You can disable that in code. Carefully read `docs/PAYOUTS.md`.
* Also, keep in mind that **unlocking and payouts will halt in case of backend or node RPC errors**. In that case check everything and restart.
* You must restart module if you see errors with the word *suspended*.
* Don't run payouts and unlocker modules as part of mining node. Create separate configs for both, launch independently and make sure you have a single instance of each module running.
* If `poolFeeAddress` is not specified all pool profit will remain on coinbase address. If it specified, make sure to periodically send some dust back required for payments.

### Mordor

To use this pool on the mordor testnet two settings require changing to "mordor"

network in your config.json (this sets backend (validation,unlocker) to mordor paramaters)
APP.Network in your www/config/environment.js (this sets the frontend to mordor paramaters)
rerun ./build.sh


### Extra) How To Secure the pool frontend with Let's Encrypt (https)

First, install the Certbot's Nginx package with apt-get

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3-certbot-nginx
```

And then open your nginx setting file, make sure the server name is configured!

```
$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
. . .
server_name <your-pool-domain>;
. . .
```

Change the _ to your pool domain, and now you can obtain your auto-renewaled ssl certificate for free!

```
$ sudo certbot --nginx -d <your-pool-domain>
```

Now you can access your pool's frontend via https! Share your pool link!
